Social Media Web App

A social media web app utilizes MongoDB, Express, Node.js, EJS, and Passport.js for user authentication, authorization, and various functionalities. Users can log in with a username and password and manage their own posts, comments, and profile. The app supports features like adding/removing friends, liking posts and comments, and engaging in chat conversations. Flash messages provide notifications during sign-in/sign-out, and users receive email notifications for comments.
